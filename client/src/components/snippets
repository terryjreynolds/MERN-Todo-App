//right here i need to call a props function to set state
      //of loggedIn to true in app.js. From there, app.js sends
      //the state via props to navbar, so it can change the text to logout
      //on the logout route, I need to call the same props function
      //to set the loggedIn to false, thus changing the navbar text to login

      [*] establish a state function in app.js (loggedIn)
      [*] set the value of the login button text to jsx of loggedIn state
      [*] write a function in app.js to set the state of loggedIn
      [] pass the function as props to login.js and to navbar.js
      [*] somehow make the login/logout button choose what to do on click based on
      app.js state
      [*] at line 64 login component, call the function to set the state of app.js 
      to true.
      [] LOGOUT: while the login button is "login", it needs to use the props 
      function to set the state of app.js loggedIn to false.
