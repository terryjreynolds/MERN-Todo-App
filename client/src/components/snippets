        //using some mongoose method such as findOneAndDelete. returning success
        //to the dropdown which needs to trigger a render and redirect.
        //ideally, it should put up a card asking for password before
        //carrying out the deletion. I should be able to find the id or
        //username on req.user as it is carried along with the headers on 
        //every request while a session exists

        [*] user hits delelte account button
        [*] onClick a modal card should appear
        [*] construct a modal form that receives input of password
        [*] modal compares password. If good follow route to delete. If bad
        kick out alert that says 'password incorrect'. 'Deletion Unsuccesful'
        Note: the modal needs to compare the hashed password with the password found 
        on the user with the current session id (found on req.user)
        [*] build the delete route
        [*] use password from form data to make object to send to endpoint
      [*] has the password and compare to has found in req.user
      [] flash account delelted 
      [] redirect to dasboard


i put the showCard state in Navbar. The delete button in dropdownmenu sets that state
to false, so the card css is display: none. But immediately after rendering of dropdownmenu
it navigates to /Todo. Why? I don't have any react router stuff in there. On navigation
to Todo, it triggers redering of app, navbar and Todo, but it can't find the username
so it throws an error.
